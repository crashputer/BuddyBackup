# BuddyBackup
BuddyBackup is a two-way non-cloud offsite backup solution to be shared between two entities.

[What is BuddyBackup?]
This project aims to make an easy-to-install secure offsite two-way backup solution that does NOT rely on any cloud services, subscriptions, or any other outside influences. This project is intended to run on two PCs with similar data storage capacities in separate physical locations. The two-way aspect allows users at both location to store files which will be securely backed up to the other PC. Files sent to the remote location for backup will be encrypted. BackupBuddy is a tool to be used as part of the standard 3-2-1 data backup process.

[Why?]
Your data is YOURS, and it deserves to be protected. Regardless of your opinion of various backup companies, you should have the option to safely back your data up without it leaving your control.

[Example Use Cases]
- Friends A and B wish to back up their personal files. Each friend keeps a computer running BackupBuddy at their house.
- Small Business owner wishes to back up their data from their office to their house. Why not also have the ability to back up their home files to their office? 

[What does BuddyBackup NOT do?]
- File revisions. This project does not have any change logs or accidental file deletion protection.
- Cryptolocker protection, because there are no file revisions/version history files being generated.
